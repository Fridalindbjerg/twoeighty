            <h3>thykassen</h3>
            <p>
              We created a visual identity for Thykassen that captures the raw,
              natural beauty of the West Jutland landscape. Through authentic
              imagery and film, we told a story about simplicity,
              sustainability, and local produce. Our goal was to highlight
              what’s real – no filters, no fuss – and let the atmosphere speak
              for itself.
              <br />
              <br />
              With a warm, human-centered aesthetic, we developed a campaign that
              works across platforms – from website and social media to print and
              video.

                We aimed to showcase both the product and the people behind it

                attention to the local spirit and subtle moments, helping
                Thykassen attract new customers while building stronger
                connections within their community.

              <h3>microsoft</h3>
              <p>
                We created a brand film for Microsoft that highlights how trust
                and technology intersect in one of the world’s most remote and
                rugged landscapes — Iceland. The narrative follows individuals
                who rely on digital infrastructure in their daily lives, set
                against vast, cinematic scenery.

              This project was about capturing the quiet strength of Icelandic
              communities and illustrating how Microsoft’s technologies enable
              connection, resilience, and progress. We used a grounded visual
              language to tell a human-centered story — one that reflects both
              innovation and intimacy.

          <h3>fitness world</h3>
          <p>
            We created a visual campaign for Fitness World that celebrates
            movement, community, and the individuality of every training
            journey. Through cinematic storytelling and diverse casting, we
            showcased how fitness can be a part of life at any stage — whether
            in a gym, a forest, or anywhere in between.

                The project focused on portraying authenticity and energy across
                a wide range of personalities and physical expressions. We
                wanted to move beyond clichés and create a campaign rooted in
                realness, drive, and self-empowerment — making fitness feel both
                approachable and aspirational.
