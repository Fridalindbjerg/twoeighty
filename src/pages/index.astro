        <h3>thykassen</h3>
        <p>We created a visual identity for Thykassen that captures the raw, natural beauty of the West Jutland landscape. Through authentic imagery and film, we told a story about simplicity, sustainability, and local produce. Our goal was to highlight what’s real – no filters, no fuss – and let the atmosphere speak for itself.</p>

          <p>With a warm, human-centered aesthetic, we developed a campaign that works across platforms – from website and social media to print and video. We aimed to showcase both the product and the people behind it in a relatable and honest way. All content was crafted with attention to the local spirit and subtle moments, helping Thykassen attract new customers while building stronger connections within their community.</p>

          <h3>microsoft</h3>
          <p>We created a brand film for Microsoft that highlights how trust and technology intersect in one of the world’s most remote and rugged landscapes — Iceland. The narrative follows individuals who rely on digital infrastructure in their daily lives, set against vast, cinematic scenery.</p>

        <p>This project was about capturing the quiet strength of Icelandic communities and illustrating how Microsoft’s technologies enable connection, resilience, and progress. We used a grounded visual language to tell a human-centered story — one that reflects both innovation and intimacy.</p>

        <h3>fitness world</h3>
        <p>We created a visual campaign for Fitness World that celebrates movement, community, and the individuality of every training journey. Through cinematic storytelling and diverse casting, we showcased how fitness can be a part of life at any stage — whether in a gym, a forest, or anywhere in between.</p>

            <p>The project focused on portraying authenticity and energy across a wide range of personalities and physical expressions. We wanted to move beyond clichés and create a campaign rooted in realness, drive, and self-empowerment — making fitness feel both approachable and aspirational.</p>
